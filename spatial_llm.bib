Definition: Object detection in Earth Vision refers to localizing obects of interest (e.g., vehicles, airplanes) on the earth’s surface and predicting their categories

_Challenges of Earth Vision:_
- Vast changes in scale of object. depending on resolution. 

- Arbitrary object rotation (i.e. no "up" like there is in regular object detection). 

- Object clustering crowds images. 

- Object count are imbalances. E.g. a 200 x 200 m car yard could have 100 cars, but a 2000 x 2000 stretch of desert might only have one or two. 

- Training data ususally in perfect condition, test is not. --> COMMENT, for pre-processing large swathes of maps, we can assume this away. 

Properties of a good dataset: 
1) a large number of images,
2) many instances per categories, 
3) properly oriented object annotation, and 
4) many different classes of objects, which make it approach to real-world applications.


Categories: plane, ship, storage tank, baseball dia-
mond, tennis court, swimming pool, ground track field, harbor, bridge, large vehicle, small vehicle, helicopter, roundabout, soccer ball field and basketball court. --> COMMENT: Limited utility in these classes.},

retrieve information from remote sensing imagery using Visual Questions answering.

__ Quotes and Refs__
"the ability to use remote sensing data as a direct source of information is currently limited to experts within the remote sensing and computer vision communities"

"The objective of VQA is to answer a free-form and open-ended question about a given image"

"A VQA model is generally made of four distinct components: 
1) a visual feature extractor; 
2) a language feature extractor; 
3) a fusion step between the two modalities; and
4) a prediction component."

"we use the openly accessible OpenStreetMap (OSM) data containing geolocalized information provided by volunteers."

"Dataset attributes for question answer pairs:
Questions:  
1. Classify a map element to a category. 
2. Derive attributes: Shape / Size etc. 
3. Determine Relative location  to other elements. 
4. NL questions generated to match the observed elements. 
Answers: 
Extract the objects corresponding to the question type: 
1. Counting 
2. Presence
3. Area of
4. Comparison Between
5. Rural / Urban. 

"due to the source of our data (OSM),
the questions are only on a specific set of static objects (e.g., buildings and roads). Other objects of interest for applications of a VQA system to remote sensing would also include different static objects, moving objects (e.g., cars), or seasonal aspects. Including these objects would require another
source of data or manual construction of qestion/answer pairs." --> COMMENT: Justification for future work!!!!

__COMMENTS__
- Use the accessibility to experts quote.
- Their concluding remarks about the mlimitations of OSM are useful starting point to justify my idea.
- Their technical approach to VQA is relevant and useful.},

- Good to know that i can get OSM in RDF.
- Lol, References STEWARD

- They used manual mappings from OSM classed to DBPedia Classes. 

- They use Frankenstine, an implementation of QUanary which is a foral method for developing QA pipelines. 

- They use pre-defined query template patterns and map natural language inputs to those templates. Cool idea and applicable to 848e as well. 

- The NLP to Query generation part of this one is one of the main challenges.

abstract = {We use representations and expectations formed during life-long learning to support attentional allocation and perception. In comparison to traditional laboratory investigations, real-world memory formation is usually achieved without explicit instruction and on-the-fly as a by-product of natural interactions with our environment. Understanding this process and the quality of naturally formed representations is critical to understanding how memory is used to guide attention and perception. Utilizing immersive, navigable, and realistic virtual environments, we investigated incidentally generated memory representations by comparing them to memories for items which were explicitly memorized. Participants either searched for objects embedded in realistic indoor environments or explicitly memorized them for follow-up identity and location memory tests. We show for the first time that memory for the identity of naturalistic objects and their location in 3D space is higher after incidental encoding compared to explicit memorization, even though the subsequent memory tests came as a surprise to participants. Relating gaze behavior to memory performance revealed that encoding time was more predictive of subsequent memory when participants explicitly memorized an item, compared to incidentally encoding it. Our results suggest that the active nature of guiding attentional allocation during proactive behavior allows for behaviorally optimal formation and utilization of representations. This highlights the importance of investigating cognition under ecologically valid conditions and shows that understanding the most natural processes for encoding and maintaining information is critical for understanding adaptive behavior.}

This system, developed within the scope of the European project RACE, integrates detection, tracking, learning and recognition of tabletop objects. Interaction capabilities were also developed to enable a human user to take the role of instructor and teach new object categories. Thus, the system learns in an incremental and open-ended way from user-mediated experiences. Based on the analysis of memory requirements for storing both semantic and perceptual data, a dual memory approach, comprising a semantic memory and a perceptual memory, was adopted. The perceptual memory is the central data structure of the described perception and learning system. The goal of this paper is twofold: on one hand, we provide a thorough description of the developed system, starting with motivations, cognitive considerations and architecture design, then providing details on the developed modules, and finally presenting a detailed evaluation of the system; on the other hand, we emphasize the crucial importance of the Point Cloud Library (PCL) for developing such system.11This paper is a revised and extended version of Oliveira et al.

abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

The answer to such questions is vital for outlier detection (terrorist networks, or illegal money-laundering rings), forecasting, and simulations (“how will a computer virus spread?”). The heart of the problem is finding the properties of real graphs that seem to persist over multiple disciplines. We list such “laws” and, more importantly, we propose a simple, parsimonious model, the “recursive matrix” (R-MAT) model, which can quickly generate realistic graphs, capturing the essence of each graph in only a few parameters. Contrary to existing generators, our model can trivially generate weighted, directed and bipartite graphs; it subsumes the celebrated Erdős-Rényi model as a special case; it can match the power law behaviors, as well as the deviations from them (like the “winner does not take it all” model of Pennock et al. [21]). We present results on multiple, large real graphs, where we show that our parameter fitting algorithm (AutoMAT-fast) fits them very well. }

Their taxonomoy of query types \textit{topological, metric} and \textit{direction} are consistent with the broader literature.

  comment={Della Penna et al seek to conduct information extraction of PDF documents so that they can query the content of the document based on its spatial relations (e.g. positions of images on a page). They develop the Spatial Relation Query Language (SRQL) that allows for direction relation queries to be specified in a SQL-like syntax. Their spatial concatenation queries allow for identificatons of objects that are LEFT, RIGHT, UP and DOWN from each other. The work itself is of limited direct utility because of the focus on PDF documents, but the ability to query by relative locations is useful. The SRQL query interface is much less intuitive to a lay-user than a pictorial interface is. This paper is relevant to GESTALT and COMPASS because it provides an example of another system that conducts spatial pattern matching based on the arrangement of objects.}

  comment={Della Penna et. al.'s 2017 work seeks to formally define spatial relations into a taxonomy. Their taxonomy is comprehensive, but the concepts of particular use to GESTALT and COMPASS are \textit{Concatenation} relations (effectively, those that arent intersection or containment relations). Within concatenation queries they identify the postitional \textit{Left, Right, Up, Down} as well as a \textit{weak} modifier. They also describe \textit{linked} relations, which resemble graphs or constraint satisfaction networks. The difference is that the linked strucutres explicitly encode the relationships between objects, where they are implicit in the other. While their language is expressive, it is not suitable for the tasks we use GESTALT for, as it focuses on information extraction tasks rather than navigation or geospatial search.}

They seek to improve on the current optimization approaches which focused on algorithmic improvement in serial implementations, naive parallelization and map reduce as the existing approaches to leverage more computing power. Their method occurs over three phases. First, they partition the underlying space. Then they group the partitions together by objects and finally conduct a cascading pairwise spatial join. Their empirical evaluation suggests that selecting a discriminative join order is essential to efficent execution. Their system appears to only support topological and possibly metric queries, and so is not suitable for use in GESTALT/COMPASS which relies on directional relationships to prune the result space.}

  comment={SpaceKey is a system designed for spatial pattern matching. It seeks to broaden spatial searching by offering features beyond what is commonly available with popular spatial keyword queries. SpaceKey allows users to search for patterns of objects based on metric (distance) relations and the inclusion or exclusion of certain objects within those distances. The detail of query completion is not discussed in the paper. the The system has a pictorial query interface, and while it appears to allow a user to query by the relative directions of objects, closer examination suggests that the directions of objects have no bearing on the search results. Overall, the system shows that spatial pattern matching is an area of active research in geospatial computing and that there is a gap in direction relation pattern matching.}

  comment={Fang et al.'s evaluation paper sets out to review spatial pattern matching approaches and evaluate them. They focus their comparison between Spatial Keyword Matching, Multi-Way Spatial Joins and Spatial Pattern Matching (their approach). They define the SPM problem formally as a graph requiring that each vertex has a keyword label, each edge has a distance interval and each edge has a sign (exclusion in, exclusion out, mutual exclusion and multiple inclusion). COMPASS' approach violates all of these conditions by not formulating the SPM problem as a graph problem. However, we do require that objects have labels. They implement two algorithms to solve spatial pattern matching, both of which rely on approximate isomorphic subgraph matching to solve. Their \textbf{Multi-Pair-Join (MPJ)} algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(m\zeta |D|^2+\xi)$ where $\zeta$ is a sampling threshold in range $[0,1]$ and $\xi$ is the maximal number of partial matches. Their \textbf{Multi-Star-Join (MSJ)} algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^4+m|D|^2+\xi)$ time worst case, but practically its running time is faster than the MPJ. The SPM algorithm is extended with two sub-variants. Top-K SPM is used to refine the results set when recall is too high, and Partial SPM is used when too few results are returned. Both incur additional computational cost. Their evaluation is focused on execution time, and shows that both of their approaches are faster to execute over the spatial pattern matching problem than generic subgraph matching algorithms are.}

  comment={Liu et. al. use an open shape-based strategy to search for relatively positioned objects not aligned to the global coordinate system. For example, being "In Front" of a building that is oriented "west", when the global coordinate system assumes "front" is "north". They build on earlier work using a Range Query Strategy (RQS) where the minimum (globally aligned) bounding rectangle that covers the query space is used for initial retrieval, and then pruned. OSS creates an open shape based on the query parameters and then uses containment and intersection queries to check for objects which satisfy the query. This work is closely aligned to COMPASS in that it assumes the query is from the perspective of the user, and it allows for querying based on the realive position of objects. However, it does not allow for directional pattern matching or keyword pattern matching, both of which are important to the functioning of COMPASS and GESTALT.}

  comment={Papadias et. al. set out to to develop a unified and adjustable framework that permits the definition of any type of spatial relation and the automatic generation of similarities between them. Their work is motivated by the lack of spatial queries for structural similarity. Exisiting constraint satisfaction problems aren't efficent enough and do not leverage the existing data structures. They develop Multi-Spatial-Joins (MSJ) as their approach, with the aim of achieveing a better complexity than the brute force apporach of $\mathcal{O}(N^n)$ where $N$ is the number of objects in the database and $n$ is the number of query objects. Their approach creates pairwise, bitwise encodings that describe the intersection of the two objects across a collection of topological, directional and distance measures. They implement three algorithims, Multi-Forward-Checking (MFC), a constraint satisfaction approach which their experiments show runs exponentially to the number of query terms. Their Window Reduction (WR) approach is a CSP FC algorithm that punes the search space over time, and their Joint Window Reduction (JWR) algorithm runs is a slightly more efficient version of WR that does not need to exhaustively search for a starting point. This work considers fuzzy querying, directional relations and pictorial querying, highlighting its relevance to COMPASS and GESTALT. Their use of Window Reduction is reminiscent of our approach to pruning the search space each iteration.}

They develop a nearest neighbour graph and in conjunction with iterative pruning and early stopping develop a graph-matching approach. Their worst-case complexity is $\mathcal{O}(n^k)$ with expected complexity of $\mathcal{O}(NK)$. Their work is not directly comparable to COMPASS, but does reflect the difficulty of detecting patterns within spatial data.}

  comment={Zhang et. al. introduce the m Closest-Keywords query. The mCK query searches based on the co-occurance of keywords within a given distance. While a powerful approach, it does not allow us to improve precision of results by specifying the relative spatial positions of objects. For our use-case of searching by locations, the bR-Tree may conflate locations when returning matches, however this would be acceptable in line with our 'fuzzy matching' approach. While it is not explicitly human-centric, it is a step towards realistic search needs of humans.}

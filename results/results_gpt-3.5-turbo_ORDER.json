Where there are multiple possible answers, select the most likely. Answer as briefly as possible, preferring single word answers where they suffice. Where you do not know the answer, it is unanswerable or you are uncertain, return 'ICATQ'. You will be asked about order relations describe the cyclic order in which objects appear with respect to their centroid. To answer these questions, imagine a line anchored on the given centroid with its far end at the first object. If it is shorter to rotate that line to the right to reach the second object it is a `clockwise' rotation. If it is shorter to rotate to the left it is 'counterclockwise'"

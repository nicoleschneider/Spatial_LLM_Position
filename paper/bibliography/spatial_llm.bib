Definition: Object detection in Earth Vision refers to localizing obects of interest (e.g., vehicles, airplanes) on the earth’s surface and predicting their categories

_Challenges of Earth Vision:_
- Vast changes in scale of object. depending on resolution. 

- Arbitrary object rotation (i.e. no "up" like there is in regular object detection). 

- Object clustering crowds images. 

- Object count are imbalances. E.g. a 200 x 200 m car yard could have 100 cars, but a 2000 x 2000 stretch of desert might only have one or two. 

- Training data ususally in perfect condition, test is not. --> COMMENT, for pre-processing large swathes of maps, we can assume this away. 

Properties of a good dataset: 
1) a large number of images,
2) many instances per categories, 
3) properly oriented object annotation, and 
4) many different classes of objects, which make it approach to real-world applications.


Categories: plane, ship, storage tank, baseball dia-
mond, tennis court, swimming pool, ground track field, harbor, bridge, large vehicle, small vehicle, helicopter, roundabout, soccer ball field and basketball court. --> COMMENT: Limited utility in these classes.},

retrieve information from remote sensing imagery using Visual Questions answering.

__ Quotes and Refs__
"the ability to use remote sensing data as a direct source of information is currently limited to experts within the remote sensing and computer vision communities"

"The objective of VQA is to answer a free-form and open-ended question about a given image"

"A VQA model is generally made of four distinct components: 
1) a visual feature extractor; 
2) a language feature extractor; 
3) a fusion step between the two modalities; and
4) a prediction component."

"we use the openly accessible OpenStreetMap (OSM) data containing geolocalized information provided by volunteers."

"Dataset attributes for question answer pairs:
Questions:  
1. Classify a map element to a category. 
2. Derive attributes: Shape / Size etc. 
3. Determine Relative location  to other elements. 
4. NL questions generated to match the observed elements. 
Answers: 
Extract the objects corresponding to the question type: 
1. Counting 
2. Presence
3. Area of
4. Comparison Between
5. Rural / Urban. 

"due to the source of our data (OSM),
the questions are only on a specific set of static objects (e.g., buildings and roads). Other objects of interest for applications of a VQA system to remote sensing would also include different static objects, moving objects (e.g., cars), or seasonal aspects. Including these objects would require another
source of data or manual construction of qestion/answer pairs." --> COMMENT: Justification for future work!!!!

__COMMENTS__
- Use the accessibility to experts quote.
- Their concluding remarks about the mlimitations of OSM are useful starting point to justify my idea.
- Their technical approach to VQA is relevant and useful.},

- Good to know that i can get OSM in RDF.
- Lol, References STEWARD

- They used manual mappings from OSM classed to DBPedia Classes. 

- They use Frankenstine, an implementation of QUanary which is a foral method for developing QA pipelines. 

- They use pre-defined query template patterns and map natural language inputs to those templates. Cool idea and applicable to 848e as well. 

- The NLP to Query generation part of this one is one of the main challenges.

abstract = {We use representations and expectations formed during life-long learning to support attentional allocation and perception. In comparison to traditional laboratory investigations, real-world memory formation is usually achieved without explicit instruction and on-the-fly as a by-product of natural interactions with our environment. Understanding this process and the quality of naturally formed representations is critical to understanding how memory is used to guide attention and perception. Utilizing immersive, navigable, and realistic virtual environments, we investigated incidentally generated memory representations by comparing them to memories for items which were explicitly memorized. Participants either searched for objects embedded in realistic indoor environments or explicitly memorized them for follow-up identity and location memory tests. We show for the first time that memory for the identity of naturalistic objects and their location in 3D space is higher after incidental encoding compared to explicit memorization, even though the subsequent memory tests came as a surprise to participants. Relating gaze behavior to memory performance revealed that encoding time was more predictive of subsequent memory when participants explicitly memorized an item, compared to incidentally encoding it. Our results suggest that the active nature of guiding attentional allocation during proactive behavior allows for behaviorally optimal formation and utilization of representations. This highlights the importance of investigating cognition under ecologically valid conditions and shows that understanding the most natural processes for encoding and maintaining information is critical for understanding adaptive behavior.}

This system, developed within the scope of the European project RACE, integrates detection, tracking, learning and recognition of tabletop objects. Interaction capabilities were also developed to enable a human user to take the role of instructor and teach new object categories. Thus, the system learns in an incremental and open-ended way from user-mediated experiences. Based on the analysis of memory requirements for storing both semantic and perceptual data, a dual memory approach, comprising a semantic memory and a perceptual memory, was adopted. The perceptual memory is the central data structure of the described perception and learning system. The goal of this paper is twofold: on one hand, we provide a thorough description of the developed system, starting with motivations, cognitive considerations and architecture design, then providing details on the developed modules, and finally presenting a detailed evaluation of the system; on the other hand, we emphasize the crucial importance of the Point Cloud Library (PCL) for developing such system.11This paper is a revised and extended version of Oliveira et al.

abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

The answer to such questions is vital for outlier detection (terrorist networks, or illegal money-laundering rings), forecasting, and simulations (“how will a computer virus spread?”). The heart of the problem is finding the properties of real graphs that seem to persist over multiple disciplines. We list such “laws” and, more importantly, we propose a simple, parsimonious model, the “recursive matrix” (R-MAT) model, which can quickly generate realistic graphs, capturing the essence of each graph in only a few parameters. Contrary to existing generators, our model can trivially generate weighted, directed and bipartite graphs; it subsumes the celebrated Erdős-Rényi model as a special case; it can match the power law behaviors, as well as the deviations from them (like the “winner does not take it all” model of Pennock et al. [21]). We present results on multiple, large real graphs, where we show that our parameter fitting algorithm (AutoMAT-fast) fits them very well. }

Their taxonomoy of query types \textit{topological, metric} and \textit{direction} are consistent with the broader literature.

GESTALT's hierarchical data structure does conduct an implicit enclosure query - where we know that for a match to occur it must be enclosed in a location.}

They develop the Spatial Relation Query Language (SRQL) that allows for direction relation queries to be specified in a SQL-like syntax. Their spatial concatenation queries allow for identificatons of objects that are LEFT, RIGHT, UP and DOWN from each other. The work itself is of limited direct utility because of the focus on PDF documents, but the ability to query by relative locations is useful. The SRQL query interface is much less intuitive to a lay-user than a pictorial interface is. This paper is relevant to GESTALT and COMPASS because it provides an example of another system that conducts spatial pattern matching based on the arrangement of objects.}

  comment={Della Penna et. al.'s 2017 work seeks to formally define spatial relations into a taxonomy. Their taxonomy is comprehensive, but the concepts of particular use to GESTALT and COMPASS are \textit{Concatenation} relations (effectively, those that arent intersection or containment relations). Within concatenation queries they identify the postitional \textit{Left, Right, Up, Down} as well as a \textit{weak} modifier. They also describe \textit{linked} relations, which resemble graphs or constraint satisfaction networks. The difference is that the linked strucutres explicitly encode the relationships between objects, where they are implicit in the other. While their language is expressive, it is not suitable for the tasks we use GESTALT for, as it focuses on information extraction tasks rather than navigation or geospatial search.}

They seek to improve on the current optimization approaches which focused on algorithmic improvement in serial implementations, naive parallelization and map reduce as the existing approaches to leverage more computing power. Their method occurs over three phases. First, they partition the underlying space. Then they group the partitions together by objects and finally conduct a cascading pairwise spatial join. Their empirical evaluation suggests that selecting a discriminative join order is essential to efficent execution. Their system appears to only support topological and possibly metric queries, and so is not suitable for use in GESTALT/COMPASS which relies on directional relationships to prune the result space.}

  comment={SpaceKey is a system designed for spatial pattern matching. It seeks to broaden spatial searching by offering features beyond what is commonly available with popular spatial keyword queries. SpaceKey allows users to search for patterns of objects based on metric (distance) relations and the inclusion or exclusion of certain objects within those distances. The detail of query completion is not discussed in the paper. the The system has a pictorial query interface, and while it appears to allow a user to query by the relative directions of objects, closer examination suggests that the directions of objects have no bearing on the search results. Overall, the system shows that spatial pattern matching is an area of active research in geospatial computing and that there is a gap in direction relation pattern matching.}

  comment={Fang et al.'s evaluation paper sets out to review spatial pattern matching approaches and evaluate them. They focus their comparison between Spatial Keyword Matching, Multi-Way Spatial Joins and Spatial Pattern Matching (their approach). They define the SPM problem formally as a graph requiring that each vertex has a keyword label, each edge has a distance interval and each edge has a sign (exclusion in, exclusion out, mutual exclusion and multiple inclusion). COMPASS' approach violates all of these conditions by not formulating the SPM problem as a graph problem. However, we do require that objects have labels. They implement two algorithms to solve spatial pattern matching, both of which rely on approximate isomorphic subgraph matching to solve. Their \textbf{Multi-Pair-Join (MPJ)} algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(m\zeta |D|^2+\xi)$ where $\zeta$ is a sampling threshold in range $[0,1]$ and $\xi$ is the maximal number of partial matches. Their \textbf{Multi-Star-Join (MSJ)} algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^4+m|D|^2+\xi)$ time worst case, but practically its running time is faster than the MPJ. The SPM algorithm is extended with two sub-variants. Top-K SPM is used to refine the results set when recall is too high, and Partial SPM is used when too few results are returned. Both incur additional computational cost. Their evaluation is focused on execution time, and shows that both of their approaches are faster to execute over the spatial pattern matching problem than generic subgraph matching algorithms are.}

  comment={Liu et. al. use an open shape-based strategy to search for relatively positioned objects not aligned to the global coordinate system. For example, being "In Front" of a building that is oriented "west", when the global coordinate system assumes "front" is "north". They build on earlier work using a Range Query Strategy (RQS) where the minimum (globally aligned) bounding rectangle that covers the query space is used for initial retrieval, and then pruned. OSS creates an open shape based on the query parameters and then uses containment and intersection queries to check for objects which satisfy the query. This work is closely aligned to COMPASS in that it assumes the query is from the perspective of the user, and it allows for querying based on the realive position of objects. However, it does not allow for directional pattern matching or keyword pattern matching, both of which are important to the functioning of COMPASS and GESTALT.}

  comment={Papadias et. al. set out to to develop a unified and adjustable framework that permits the definition of any type of spatial relation and the automatic generation of similarities between them. Their work is motivated by the lack of spatial queries for structural similarity. Exisiting constraint satisfaction problems aren't efficent enough and do not leverage the existing data structures. They develop Multi-Spatial-Joins (MSJ) as their approach, with the aim of achieveing a better complexity than the brute force apporach of $\mathcal{O}(N^n)$ where $N$ is the number of objects in the database and $n$ is the number of query objects. Their approach creates pairwise, bitwise encodings that describe the intersection of the two objects across a collection of topological, directional and distance measures. They implement three algorithims, Multi-Forward-Checking (MFC), a constraint satisfaction approach which their experiments show runs exponentially to the number of query terms. Their Window Reduction (WR) approach is a CSP FC algorithm that punes the search space over time, and their Joint Window Reduction (JWR) algorithm runs is a slightly more efficient version of WR that does not need to exhaustively search for a starting point. This work considers fuzzy querying, directional relations and pictorial querying, highlighting its relevance to COMPASS and GESTALT. Their use of Window Reduction is reminiscent of our approach to pruning the search space each iteration.}

abstract = {Spatial variability is a prominent feature of various geographic phenomena such as climatic zones, USDA plant hardiness zones, and terrestrial habitat types (e.g., forest, grasslands, wetlands, and deserts). However, current deep learning methods follow a spatial-one-size-fits-all (OSFA) approach to train single deep neural network models that do not account for spatial variability. Quantification of spatial variability can be challenging due to the influence of many geophysical factors. In preliminary work, we proposed a spatial variability aware neural network (SVANN-I, formerly called SVANN) approach where weights are a function of location but the neural network architecture is location independent. In this work, we explore a more flexible SVANN-E approach where neural network architecture varies across geographic locations. In addition, we provide a taxonomy of SVANN types and a physics inspired interpretation model. Experiments with aerial imagery based wetland mapping show that SVANN-I outperforms OSFA and SVANN-E performs the best of all.},

Characterizing geo-entities is integral to various application domains, such as geo-intelligence and map comprehension, while a key challenge is to capture the spatial-varying context of an entity. We hypothesize that we shall know the characteristics of a geo-entity by its surrounding entities, similar to knowing word meanings by their linguistic context. Accordingly, we propose a novel spatial language model, SpaBERT, which provides a general-purpose geo-entity representation based on neighboring entities in geospatial data. SpaBERT extends BERT to capture linearized spatial context, while incorporating a spatial coordinate embedding mechanism to preserve spatial relations of entities in the 2-dimensional space. SpaBERT is pretrained with masked language modeling and masked entity prediction tasks to learn spatial dependencies. We apply SpaBERT to two downstream tasks: geo-entity typing and geo-entity linking. Compared with the existing language models that do not use spatial context, SpaBERT shows significant performance improvement on both tasks. We also analyze the entity representation from SpaBERT in various settings and the effect of spatial coordinate embedding.",

Users do not need to be experts in structured query languages to interact with systems built upon such models. This provides great opportunities to reduce the barrier of information retrieval for the general public. By introducing LLMs into spatial data management, we envisage an LLM-based spatial database system to learn from both structured and unstructured spatial data. Such a system will offer seamless access to spatial knowledge for the users, thus benefiting individuals, business, and government policy makers alike.},

  comment   = {LLM Spatial Vision paper that advocates for LLMs as spatial databases since they can
- Memorize facts from structured (tables) and unstructured (free text) data
- Understand user intention better since the NL input is handled by the same model that knows/understands the underlying spatial data
Proposed system, where each part may be an LLM:
- Query analyzer/planner takes NL and produces sub-queries
- Query result generators (different LLMs trained on diff data) answer each sub-query
- Result synthesizer takes results and user query to combine into one output
Experiments:
- Census income data 48842 records
-- 8 categorical, 6 numeric attributes
-- Create 20000 range queries with random numeric attribute ranges
-- Show that a GAN can memorize the distribution of the census data and generate range queries with similar selectivity to the 20000 real ones
-- Training a classifier on real data vs 1/3 real 2/3 GAN-generated can predict income attribute equally well, supporting distribution was memorized well
- Geocoords of AUS cities
-- Asked Chat-GPT for top 50 cities geocoords (49/50 correct)
-- Made random pairs (A,B) from the 50 cities and asked to which side of A is B
44/50 correct, 5 more correct when geocoords provided, 1 wrong (S vs SW)
Future Work/ Challenges:
- Faithfullness/wrong answers/hallucinations
- Use faithfullness scores; traditional query methods to get ground truth
- Structured data training challenges
-- Limited quantity of structured spatial db tables
-- Next word prediction task incompatible with tabular data
-- Values can be continuous and differ in meaning based on attribute col
-- Multiple levels of reasoning to get sub-results and combine them correctly
- Changing data (moving objects)

Notes/ideas:
- Their experiments don't really show that LLMs can learn the right info and do reasoning over it, just that they get the distributions correct and can store some directional relation knowledge about major cities - feasibility of doing that across broader variety of locations is still open.
- Directional relation test with AUS cities is relevant - but at what granularity does it break down? How to augment for remote towns?
- How to other spatial relations like topological, cyclic, etc. fare?
- Beyond pairwise relations? This must certainly do poorly - unless it's really reasoning. Easy test to show its just memorizing pairwise facts not really understanding implicit spatial relationships.},

  abstract  = {Spatial databases play a vital role in many applications that access spatial data via appropriate queries. However, most application users lack the expertise necessary for formulating spatial queries. To fill in this gap, we propose an effective framework called NALSpatial that translates natural language queries over spatial data into executable database queries. NALSpatial consists of two core phases. The natural language understanding phase extracts key entity information, comprehends the query intent and determines the query type. The key entities and query type are passed to the subsequent natural language translation phase, which employs entity mapping rules and structured language models to construct executable database queries accordingly. We implement NALSpatial on the open-source extensible database system SECONDO to support range queries, nearest neighbor queries, spatial joins and aggregation queries. Extensive experiments show that NALSpatial on average achieves response time of about 2.5 seconds, translatability of 95\% and translation precision of 92\%, outperforming state-of-the-art natural language transformation methods.},
  articleno = {57},
  comment   = {NL-2-Spatial Query translation (length, area/intersect, knn, distance-scan instead of select, project, join) supporting queries of type:
- Range queries (find points in region P or find lines/regions intersecting a line/region P)
- Nearest neighbor queries (find k nearest to P using distance-scan over R-Tree index)
- Spatial Joins (not defined)
- Aggregation queries (not defined)
Their approach:
Natural language understanding phase
- SpaCy NER to find cardinal and quantity lists, all the nouns
- Closest cardinal num to words "nearest", "closest", or "neighbor" is k, else 1
- Check 2 KBs for nouns to determine spatial relations and locations
- LSTM trained on 2400 labeled queries used for deciding query type
Natural language translation phase
- Pre-built structured models for each query type
- Experiments on SECONDO Spatial Databases:
berlintest db- public transport, POIs, rivers in Berlin
- 50 spatial relations, 8078 locs (3040 pts, 4708 lines, 330 regions)
nanjingtest db- districts, parts of roads, POIs in Nanjing
6 spatial relations, 9900 locs (9000 pts, 887 lines, 13 regions)
100 test queries created (20 range, 20 NN, 30 spatial join, 30 agg) over the dbs
https://pan.baidu.com/s/11drm-nf9shjipT9xs8n81w?pwd=f3mo
queries like "query  feed filter [.GeoData intersects ] consume;"
- Measure response time, translatability (query acc), translation precision (result acc)
v.s. Athena++, SpatialNLI, IRNet
NALSpatial beats all by a little bit considering all 3 metrics
Notes/ideas:
- Can we use their test queries for testing COMPASS? Just the point ones? Do their spatial relations measure directional relations?
- Can we use those spatial databases as "real data" for testing COMPASS, ignoring the NL2Query thing entirely? Hand label some directional queries and show accuracy/time for COMPASS to respond? Does that buy us anything over using our OSM tags for testing?
- Should we provide SECONDO style versions of out pictorial queries? Relies on database structure in place that we don't have
- Eventually using an LLM to translate NL to query COMPASS will require the LLM producing the spatial query - can it be done pictorially, or should we use an intermediate spatial query specification like they translate to here?
- This paper kind of does exactly the NL to spatial query task I was thinking
- Limited by types of queries/spatial relations supported? Pictorial queries include complex implicit relationships. Need to understand what a spatial database is capable of storing to see if avoiding it with COMPASS data structures is even useful/faster/more flexible/more descriptive/etc.
- How does the spatial db lit compare to the SPM lit? Where is the overlap? Can SPM queries be issued over spatial dbs? Is it worth trying to translate a query pattern into a spatial db query?},

This paper investigates the extent of geospatial knowledge, awareness, and reasoning abilities encoded within such pretrained LLMs. With a focus on autoregressive language models, we devise experimental approaches related to (i) probing LLMs for geo-coordinates to assess geospatial knowledge, (ii) using geospatial and non-geospatial prepositions to gauge their geospatial awareness, and (iii) utilizing a multidimensional scaling (MDS) experiment to assess the models' geospatial reasoning capabilities and to determine locations of cities based on prompting. Our results confirm that it does not only take larger but also more sophisticated LLMs to synthesize geospatial knowledge from textual information. As such, this research contributes to understanding the potential and limitations of LLMs in dealing with geospatial information.},
  articleno = {75},
  comment   = {3 tasks to gauge geospatial reasoning ability of  LLMs:
- GEOSPATIAL KNOWLEDGE - "The geocoords / lat long of <city> is ..." as few shot (high Prediction rate, lower performance) and zero shot (lower P-rate better performance with smaller distance error). P-rate is "ability of LLM to correctly generate another city" ...?
- GEOSPATIAL AWARENESS - "<city> is near/close to/far from ..." as few shot and zero shot. "Near"/"close" cities generated had smaller distances than control "and" ones and "far" ones. LIMITATION ONLY BUCKETED METRIC RELATIONS - DOESNT CAPTURE FULL SCOPE OF SPATIAL AWARENESS. W/o state info included in city names distances are occasionally further, showing likely failed toponym disambiguation.
- GEOSPATIAL REASONING - transform coords predicted by LLM using MDS to predict location of a test city. Distances were way off but claim close enough to accurately gauge relative position of cities. NEED A MUCH MORE PRECISE DEFN OF RELATIVE USING SPATIAL RELATIONS. Seems LLM wasn't used, just to produce lat/long guesses, and then transformation applied externally for these results.
Code: https://github.com/prabin525/spatial-llm/tree/main
Notes/ideas:
- Can borrow some of the experimental setup ideas, like the prepositions, but to measure more specific spatial relations like topological ones from Papadias1998.
- Extend geospatial reasoning to get the LLM to actually do the reasoning and to measure more than just distance/metric relations.
- What does it take to teach it new unknown cities? What kind of info does it need to be able to reason spatially about that new city in the geocontext it already has?
- Any work in visual reasoning over a map rather than relying on whatever textual facts it might have absorbed during training?
- Can we correct the errors (in distance for example) that it has? Do the errors vary by city popularity? I.e. smaller errors for bigger cities that are more extensively written about?},

	- Inverted Linear (IL) Quadtree

Experiments:
- OSM
	- 33877 POIs as database (and percentages of it for smaller tests)
	- 60 most common POIs for query terms
	- tested 1500 query patterns
		- Each consisted of 2 to 6 terms with a set of "strucutres" (none fully connected)
	- for metric constraints, queries used random draw from 
		- [0, 2.7km] for max dist
		- [0, 550m] for min dist
- Found that adding query terms helped with early stopping
- Compared against simple baseline that does ESPM normally and checks the topo constraints at the final step

Notes/Ideas:
- No new efficiency in the algorithm introduced here, just added topological support to ESPM, whcih is still SOTA
- Complexity is probably the same as ESPM just with a constant factor for the extra checks happeneing at each comparison if there are also topo relations defined there
- Why not also do this with directional relations to have an SPM framework that supports all 3 major relation types?},

abstract = {This paper examines the performance of ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), in a geographic information systems (GIS) exam. As LLMs like ChatGPT become increasingly prevalent in various domains, including education, it is important to understand their capabilities and limitations in specialized subject areas such as GIS. Human learning of spatial concepts significantly differs from LLM training methodologies. Therefore, this study aims to assess ChatGPT's performance and ability to grasp geospatial concepts by challenging it with a real GIS exam. By analyzing ChatGPT's responses and evaluating its understanding of GIS principles, we gain insights into the potential applications and challenges of LLMs in spatially-oriented fields. We conduct our evaluation with two models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to understand whether general improvements of an LLM translate to improvements in answering questions related to the spatial domain. We find that both GPT variants can pass a balanced, introductory GIS exam, scoring 63.3\% (GPT-3.5) and 88.3\% (GPT-4), which correspond to grades D and B+ respectively in standard US letter grading scale. In addition, we also identify specific questions and topics where the LLMs struggle to grasp spatial concepts, highlighting the challenges in teaching such topics to these models. Finally, we assess ChatGPT's performance in specific aspects of GIS, including spatial analysis, basic concepts of mapping, and data management. This granular analysis provides further insights into the strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT's GIS literacy. This research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on the integration of AI models in education and can provide guidance for educators, researchers, and practitioners seeking to leverage LLMs in GIS. By focusing on specific questions or concepts that pose difficulties for the LLM, this study addresses the nuances of teaching spatial concepts to AI models and offers potential avenues for improvement in spatial literacy within future iterations of LLMs.},

ABSTRACT = {The emergence and rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), represented by OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), has brought up new opportunities across various industries and disciplines. These cutting-edge technologies are transforming the way we interact with information, communicate, and solve complex problems. We conducted a pilot study exploring making maps with ChatGPT, a popular artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot. Specifically, we tested designing thematic maps using given or public geospatial data, as well as creating mental maps purely using textual descriptions of geographic space. We conclude that ChatGPT provides a useful alternative solution for mapping given its unique advantages, such as lowering the barrier to producing maps, boosting the efficiency of massive map production, and understanding geographical space with its spatial thinking capability. However, mapping with ChatGPT still has limitations at the current stage, such as its unequal benefits for different users and dependence on user intervention for quality control.},

\subsection{LLM Issues a query to a DB Instead}
Propose having LLMs use outside tools and issue queries as TRADITIONAL SPATIAL QUERY or PICTORIAL QUERY.
    Read calculators paper and reference it

    \paragraph{TRADITIONAL Query}
        NALSpatial success but 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Their parsing is brittle - Keywords "nearest", "closest", "farthest"
            \item Query type limits based on pre-built query structures? 
                    Rules like closest cardinal number to "nearest"/"closest"/"farthest" doesn't allow for full breadth of NL ways to express the query
        \end{enumerate}
    
        Can we do SPM like this? Get constraints from NL and do QCN/SGM type SPM?
        

    \paragraph{PICTORIAL Query}
        How to infer implicit relations from NL?

        Is it worth doing? Benefits over traditional?

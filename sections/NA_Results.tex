\section{Results}
\label{section:results}

In this section we discuss the results (R1 - R5) of the experiments E1 - E5 that were laid out in the previous section.

\subsection{Spatial Entities} % -----------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{R1. Non-point Data}


\subsubsection{R2. Lesser-known Cities}
--> Show correlation between cities recognized and their population size. Plot for each population value tested the binary value indicating if it was recognized or not by Chat-GPT.
Give the phrase Chat-GPT outputs when a location is not recognized.
Plot accuracy of result vs. population size.

%\osullikomment{I think you might get some intersting outliers. E.g. I think Port Arthur will be massively over-represented because it was the site of our last mass shooting, and the catalyst for gun control in Australia. So there are a million articles that talk about Port Arthur, even though it's tiny in real terms.}



\subsection{Spatial Relations} % -----------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{R3. Multi-way Spatial Relations}



\subsubsection{R4. Non-directional Spatial Relations}
Report percent of triples that it got the order relation correct.
Report percent of pairs for which topological relation was correct.


\subsubsection{R5. Spatiotemporal and Multiple Hop Relations}
Report percent of 2 hop spatial queries correct.
Report percent of space + time queries correct.
Report for more hops if tested.
